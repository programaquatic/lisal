# LISAL: Likely Inaccurate Simulation of Aquarium Life

## Vision
A long-term experiment to learn Rust along with game development,
graphics, simulation of natural processes in aquariums.  The ultimate
goal is to create a virtual aquarium that's not just placing models of
plants and fish with some nice shaders and have the user admire the
graphics.  This is to really model and simulate the actual processes
that happen.  This eventually might include:

 * the flow of water, driven by pumps and constrained by the content
   of the tank based on fluid dynamics as close as possible with given
   resources

 * The level and changes of nutrients and substances in the water

 * Simulated growth/death of plant, bacteria, and fish based on water
   parameters and their impact on nutrients and flow of water.

The big vision is to allow plugins for each of the parts that
essentially plug into the fluid simulation.


## Getting There
I owned an aquarium in the past and couldn't have one for quite some
time now because life got in the way.  In 2022, I started to learn
Rust and stumbled over the ECS-based game engine
[Bevy](https://bevyengine.org/) and that got me started.

It's going to be a long term project to learn about everything that's
involved.  It's about programming and game development.  It's about
learning to simulate the flow of water.  It's about to study fractal
math of growing plants and the biology of bacterial spread and the
chemistry of water parameters as well as their interactions.


## Contributing
Contributions are welcome given the following conditions:

 * This project is a learning journey created in my limited spare
   time and as such I'd like to understand your contribution and learn
   what and how things are done.  This means that the progress might
   not be as fast as it could be.  I hope this is acceptable.  I'm
   really looking forward to learn from contributions and thus, I
   might ask for explanation and clarification out of curiosity (not
   because I question what you did).

 * Be respectful and patient.  This is about learning, not about being
   perfect from the start.

 * Obviously, you agree to the license terms and your code
   contributions are not copyrighted in a way that's incompatible with
   the license of this project.

 * Please make meaningful contributions beyond fixing spelling
   mistakes in comments or documentation ;-)
